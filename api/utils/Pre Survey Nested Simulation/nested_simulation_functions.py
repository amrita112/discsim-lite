    Calculate discrepancy scores for three pairs of scores: L0 vs L2, L1 vs L2, and L0 vs L1.
    For each L0 (school), calculate the discrepancy score for L0 vs L2 and L0 vs L1.
    For each L1 (unit), calculate the discrepancy score for L1 vs L2.
    Plot the distributions of discrepancy scores for each pair.

        nested_scores (dict): The nested dictionary containing scores organized by L2, L1, and schools.
